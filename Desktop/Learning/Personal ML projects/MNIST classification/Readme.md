MNIST Classifier

The aim of this project is to build a classifier for the MNIST dataset that achieves over
97% accuracy on the test set.

This is my first ever project of this sort.

This is an exercise from "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems by Aurélien Géron"
